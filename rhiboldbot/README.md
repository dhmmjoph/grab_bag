# rhiboldbot

Simple, silly slack bot that reposts any mesages from a certain user in bold. Gets annoying fast. 
Probably not a good idea to actually use it as anything other than a (very breif) joke.

If for whatever reason you decide to use this, don't be silly like me and acidentally upload your
Slack API token to GitHub. Note that as soon as I did that, the Slack people noticed, disabled
the token, and sent me an email letting me know what they'd done. Nice job, Slack API team!
